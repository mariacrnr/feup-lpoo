# MINESWEEPER
The game we are developing is a version of the popular classic game MineSweeper, in which
a single player tries to clear a mined board knowing only the number of neighbouring mines for
each tile, and without detonating any of them.

The project was made for the Object-Oriented Programming Laboratory Curricular Unit (LPOO 20/21) at FEUP,
by Andr√© Santos (up201907879@edu.fe.up.pt), Maria Carneiro (up201907726@edu.fe.up.pt) and Rodrigo
Andrade (up201904967@edu.fe.up.pt).
